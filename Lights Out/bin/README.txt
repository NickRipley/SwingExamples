Lights Out by Nicholas Lloyd u0949261

My implementation of Lights Out goes beyond the basic requirements by:

	- Using .gif images for buttons on the board
	
	- Displaying a timer, which resets properly for new games.
	
	- Displaying the number of moves made, which resets properly for new games.
	
	- Having buttons "Show the Rules" & "How to Win" which when pressed display dialogue
	  boxes which define the rules and a sure way to win (if the board is winable).
	  
	- Checking to see if a custom board is winable and displaying a dialogue stating whether the 
	  board is of is not, while not preventing the play of an unwinable board.
